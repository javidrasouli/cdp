# Customer Data Platform (CDP) System Design

## Overview
A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a unified system that collects, stores, and manages customer data from multiple sources to create comprehensive customer profiles and enable personalized experiences across all touchpoints.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
**Purpose**: Collect data from various sources in real-time and batch modes

**Components**:
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for real-time data ingestion
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka/Pulsar for event streaming
- **Batch Connectors**: ETL pipelines for bulk data imports
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event notifications from external systems

**Data Sources**:
- Website interactions (clicks, page views, sessions)
- Mobile app events
- Email marketing platforms
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- E-commerce platforms
- Social media platforms
- Offline touchpoints (POS, call centers)
- Third-party data providers

### 2. Data Processing Engine
**Purpose**: Clean, transform, and enrich incoming data

**Components**:
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation and data quality checks
- **Data Transformation**: ETL/ELT processes using Apache Spark or similar
- **Identity Resolution**: Customer identity matching and deduplication
- **Data Enrichment**: Append demographic, behavioral, and contextual data

**Processing Types**:
- Real-time stream processing for immediate actions
- Batch processing for comprehensive analysis
- Micro-batch processing for near real-time insights

### 3. Unified Customer Profile Store
**Purpose**: Create and maintain single customer view (360-degree profile)

**Database Architecture**:
- **Primary Storage**: NoSQL database (MongoDB, Cassandra) for flexibility
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for relationship mapping
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for fast querying
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed profiles

**Profile Components**:
- Identity attributes (name, email, phone, IDs)
- Demographic information
- Behavioral data and preferences
- Transaction history
- Engagement timeline
- Calculated attributes and scores

### 4. Segmentation Engine
**Purpose**: Create dynamic customer segments for targeting

**Features**:
- Rule-based segmentation
- ML-powered behavioral segmentation
- Predictive segments (churn risk, lifetime value)
- Real-time segment updates
- Segment overlap analysis

**Segment Types**:
- Demographic segments
- Behavioral segments
- Lifecycle stage segments
- Value-based segments
- Predictive segments

### 5. Analytics and Insights Engine
**Purpose**: Generate actionable insights from customer data

**Capabilities**:
- Customer journey mapping
- Attribution modeling
- Cohort analysis
- Predictive analytics (CLV, churn prediction)
- Real-time dashboards
- Custom reporting

### 6. Activation Layer
**Purpose**: Enable data activation across marketing channels

**Integration Points**:
- Email marketing platforms
- Advertising platforms (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Personalization engines
- CRM systems
- Marketing automation tools
- Content management systems
